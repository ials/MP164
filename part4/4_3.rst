Accesibility-related  SDG indicators [7.1.1] [9.1.1] [11.2.1] [11.7.1]
======================================================================

This exercise's purpose is to show how to compute several SDG indicators which measure people access to a number of social servcies. 

The *Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center* (SEDAC) provides, to registered users, geospatial datasets both in geodatabase format and shapefile format. 

After downloading the data, users need a GIS software tool to visualize and analyze the data.

**SDG Indicator 7.1.1: Access to Electricity, 2023 Release (2020 – 2022)** 


This  indicator  refers to the proportion of population with access to electricity. This is expressed in percentage
figures and is disaggregated by total, urban and rural access rates per country, as well as by UN regional
and global classifications (:numref:`4.3.1`).

**SDG Indicator 9.1.1: The Rural Access Index (RAI), 2023 Release (2015 – 2022)**


This indicator is defined as the share of a country's rural population living within 2 km of an all-season road (:numref:`4.3.2`).

**SDG Indicator 11.7.1: Urban Public Space, Availability and Access, 2023 Release (2015 – 2022)**


This indicator measures the share of land allocated to public spaces and the total population with access of these spaces by age, gender and disability (:numref:`4.3.4`).
