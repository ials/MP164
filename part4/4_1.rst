Forest area as a proportion of total land area [15.1.1]
========================================================

In this exercise you will learn how to calculate the indicator 15.1.1 which is defined as the forest area as a proportion of total land area, and is expressed in percentages. To learn more about this indicator read the metadata provided under this `link <https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=15&Target=15.1>`_.
The method of computation is given by the following formula: 

:math:`\frac{\text{Forest area (reference year)}}{\text{Land area (reference year)}} * 100`,

thus we need to first define the region and reference year for which the indicator needs to be calculated. After that, we need to estimate the forest area and land area of the region. 
In this case study we'll be working on calculating the indicator for Suriname for the reference year 2019.

The first step is to access a GEE app available `here https://rayoly.users.earthengine.app/view/unsdg1511>`_ (:numref:`4.1.1`).

The GEE Code Editor will show up. The Map will show a region in Africa:


.. _4.1.1:
.. figure:: /img/4.1/4.1.1.png
	:align: center
	:width: 400px

	Entry page of the *unsdg1511* app.

Then, we need to: (i) select either a country (or an administrative region within a country); (ii) click on the *Update Map* button; and (iii) click on the *Generate Trend Graph*

The figure (:numref:`4.1.2`) shows the results for a region in Colombia:

.. _4.1.2:
.. figure:: /img/4.1/4.1.2.png
	:align: center
	:width: 400px

	Forest area change from 2000 to 2019 for *Departamento de Caqueta* in Colombia.

In case we want to download the results to display and analyze them locally, we need to click on the *Export Current Map*.  The application will export the layers to Google Drive.
