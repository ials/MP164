Change in the extent of water-related ecosystems over time [6.6.1]
====================================================================

This exercise introduces an application to calculate the **SDG indicator 6.6.1**, which tracks how different types of water-related ecosystems change in extent over time. The indicator captures data on different types of freshwater ecosystems and measures their extent change. The indicator 6.6.1 is complex and it focuses on more aspects than just **the change in the spatial extent of permanent freshwater**, but for the exercise’s simplicity sake just this unit of measure will be presented in this section. This index will be presented by the **percentage change (∆) in the area of permanent waters**. We will calculate **∆** as:

:math:`∆ = \frac{(α - β) + (ρ - σ)}{ε + β + σ}`, where:

* α - new permanent water (conversion of a no water place into a permanent water place)

* β - lost permanent water (conversion of a permanent water place into a no water place)

* ρ - seasonal to permanent (conversion of seasonal water into permanent water)

* σ - permanent to seasonal (conversion of permanent water into seasonal water)

* ε - permanent water surfaces (where permanent water is always observed)

The numerator represents the change trends of the permanent water (if the numerator is positive it means that the area of permanent water places increased with respect to the beginning of the 5 year measurement period). The denominator represents the permanent water surfaces at the beginning of the considered measurement period. 

For more information about the background of the SDG indicator 6.6.1 refer to the metadata provided under this `link <https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=6&Target=6.6>`_. 


To calculate this change index we can use the **Freshwater Ecosystems Explorer** which, according to its developers, leverages the best available science to track, monitor, and improve the health of freshwater ecosystems.

The Freshwater Ecosystems Explorer is a free and easy to use data platform. It provides accurate, up-to-date, high-resolution geospatial data depicting  the extent freshwater ecosystems change over time. 

By helping decision-makers understand dynamic ecosystem changes, the data presented on this open access platform is intended to drive action to protect and restore freshwater ecosystems and enable countries to track progress towards the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal Target 6.6.  Data can be visualized and downloaded at national, sub-national and basin levels. 

Data is available for the following:
