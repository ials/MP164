Introduction to United Nations Sustainable Development Goals
============================================================

`The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development <https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda>`_, adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, provides a “*shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future*”. At its core are the `17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) <https://sdgs.un.org/goals>`_, which are an urgent call for action by both developed and developing countries in a global partnership (:numref:`1.1.1`). The 17 SDGs comprise 169 targets which can be tracked and monitored through `231 unique indicators <https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata>`_. These indicators aim to balance the economic, social and ecological dimensions of sustainable development, by means of measurable and comparable indexes [#0]_.
