Urban Monitoring Framework
==========================

The Global Urban Monitoring Framework (UMF) was endorsed by the UN Statistical Commission in March 2022 for implementation as part of the Harmonized Global UN Systemwide Strategy for monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and New Urban Agenda (NUA) and other regional, national, and subnational urban programs. It harmonizes existing urban indices and tools, including the widely implemented City Prosperity Index (CPI). The framework aims at ensuring thematic integration and inter-linkages among various dimensions of development, disaggregation of data, and inclusion of groups that are traditionally excluded. It promotes working at different scales and functional urban areas, including ecological functional areas, enabling city comparability, and the possibility of more in-depth policy analysis.

The UMF also serves as a monitoring tool for UN-Habitat's SDG Cities Flagship Programme and supports reporting through the Voluntary Local Reviews (VLRs) and the preparation of urban data for the UN Common Country Assessments. It comprises of a set of metrics that guide stakeholders to evaluate progress of cities and urban areas by indicators, domains, city objectives, and against other cities globally.

The framework was developed in response to the request of the United Nations Statistical Commission that called for a peer review mechanism of existing urban indices and monitoring tools, as well as the need to develop and adopt an urban monitoring framework. Its development involved a consultative process led by UN-Habitat and involving 36 partners from the UN system, cities and local governments, national governments, civil society, and academia and research organizations, among others.

Several cities are already implementing the framework with the guidance of UN-Habitat. The framework is designed to allow adaption in its implementation.
