Geospatial data and technologies for SDGs
==========================================

Despite the development of the Global SDG framework was originally based on traditional statistical data [#f0]_, many statistical offices and governmental agencies have recognised the need for geospatial data to augment non-spatial information and provide new and consistent data sources, which are critical to SDGs monitoring. In fact, It has been estimated that approximately 20% of the SDG indicators can be interpreted and measured either through the direct use of geospatial data itself or through integration with complementing statistical data [#f1]_. GIS, Earth observations and global-coverage geospatial data provide an important link to enable consistent comparison among countries, provide granularity and disaggregation of the indicators and communicate their geographic dimensions [#f2]_.

Key global `geospatial data <https://www.heavy.ai/learn/geospatial>`_ products that cover major thematic areas of the biosphere and society (e.g. land cover, vegetation productivity, forests, wetlands, surface water, human settlements, etc.) are strongly supporting the methodological development and measurement of a number of SDG indicators. Generally, national or local geospatial data provide (where available) a higher spatial and temporal resolution than coarser global products and - in turn - better capabilities for accurate monitoring of SDG indicators. However, the uneven availability of such data often prevents consistent assessment of SDGs' progress across countries worldwide. In this context, the use of open global geospatial datasets represents a quick, efficient and cost-effective solution to provide a first comprehensive assessment before national data is produced and analyzed [#f3]_.
