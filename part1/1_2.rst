Measuring progress towards the SDGs [#f0]_
==========================================

The SDG Tracker presents data across all available indicators from the *Our World in Data* database, using official statistics from the UN and other international organizations. This free, open-access information tracks global progress towards the SDGs and allows people worldwide to hold their governments accountable for achieving the agreed goals.

Data is available for many indicators, but there are still gaps. We hope this collaborative approach allows us to support the UN in developing the most complete and up-to-date sources for tracking global progress.

The original SDG Tracker was published in 2018, and this revised version was launched in 2023. Authors state that they will keep this up-to-date with the most recent data and SDG developments through the end of the 2030 Agenda.
