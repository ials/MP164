Hands-on GEE primer
===================

GEE advocates state that it is “the most advanced cloud-based geospatial processing platform in the world!”  Truly or not, GEE allows users to access and efficiently analyse numerous open-source spatial databases (like Landsat and MODIS remote sensing imagery, the Global Forest Change dataset, roads, protected areas, etc.). When doing these analyses, you are using the Google servers, so you can do analyses that would take weeks, if not months, on your computer or even a fancy computer.

From GEE, users can export .csv files of any values you’ve calculated and geoTIFF files (georeferenced images) to their Google Drive account.

With GEE, users can answer research questions in an efficient way that really was just not possible before. It is possible to use large geospatial datasets to address a plethora of questions and challenges facing humanity in the modern world. We will see later on how to explore what datasets are available to work with in the GEE, and it’s also possible to import your own georeferenced imagery (like photos from drone missions). You can find out how to import your own raster data from this page on the GEE developers website.


Take a moment to familiarise yourself with the layout of the Earth Engine editor - like when first starting to learn a new language, it can seem like a lot to take in at once! With your blank script, have a go at exploring the different tabs. Notice how if you draw polygons or drop points, they will appear in your script. You can go to the Inspector tab, click on a place in the map, and see what information is available for it. Here is an outline of what most of the tabs do:

The remaining of this session illustrates how to quantify cover change & harness the power of GEE to answer research questions.

The specific aims are:

- Learn the basic principles of JavaScript
  
- Import and explore data - forest cover change as a case study
  
- Visualise forest cover change

- Calculate forest cover change over time in specific locations

- Export results - summary tables

- Further analysis and visualisation in R - the best of both worlds!


Now, you can start the GEE practical going to the numeral 4 of `this Coding Club tutorial <https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/earth-engine/>`_  [#f0]_.
