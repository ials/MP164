Google Earth Engine (GEE)
========================================================

Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a cloud-based computing platform that uses Google’s infrastructure to facilitate access to geospatial data and its processing. This platform requires an account to access, and it is free for educational and research purposes. GEE’s goals are: (i) to have a dynamic platform that facilitates the development of algorithms on a large scale; (ii) to promote high-impact research by providing free and open access; and (iii) to be part of the progress and solutions to the global demand and management of big data.

GEE has a vast catalog on a petabyte scale. It gathers information from Landsat, Sentinel, and MODIS satellites and data on climate models, temperature, and geophysical characteristics. Its intuitive interface has a code editor (https://code.earthengine.google.com/), which is an integrated development environment (IDE) for the elaboration of algorithms using JavaScript programming language. It also has a graphic window for the user to see the processes conducted. In addition, it can also work in Phyton, and others through the Earth Engine library, and R. Finally, it also has a version with a simple interface known as “Explorer” (https://explorer.earthengine.google.com/#workspace) for users with little experience in programming languages. Both options allow the entry of local data and the export of information for subsequent processing or visualization within geographic information systems (GIS) software, such as QGIS, and ArcGIS Pro, among others.
