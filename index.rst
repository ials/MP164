Monitoring of Sustainability Indicators with Geospatial Data
=======================================================================================================

Spring Semester 2024
--------------------------------------------------------

In the framework of the `United Nations Sustainable Development Goals <https://sdgs.un.org/goals>`_ (UN SDGs), the support of `geospatial data and technologies <https://www.un.org/geospatial/about/technologies>`_ has turned out to be critical for both the assessment and the monitoring of key indicators, revealing the trajectory of our planet and society towards sustainability. The increasing availability of global open geospatial datasets   opens  opportunities for the computation and comparison of these indicators across different geographical regions as well as multiple spatial and temporal scales. The added value of these datasets is tangible, especially for developing countries, where often such information is only partially available from local authorities. Nevertheless, there are still several barriers to their proficient use due to the lack of data management and processing capacity using proper `Geographic Information Systems <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system>`_ (GIS) software tools. 

In view of the above, this course promotes the use of global open geospatial datasets for computing SDG indicators. To ensure the widest possible accessibility, the material is released under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License (`CC BY 4.0 <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0>`_).

.. note:: This course was inspired by the ISPRS project "Capacity Building for GIS-based SDG Indicator Analysis with Global High-resolution Land Cover Datasets" (Oxoli et al., 2022). Although several materials are borrowed from it, this course uses spatial computing platforms in the cloud rather than locally installed software.
